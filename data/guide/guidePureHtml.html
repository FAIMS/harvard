<p>WELCOME to the Boncuklu excavation module, prepared by FAIMS for collection of excavation data at the Neolithic site of Boncuklu in Konya Province, Turkey (<a href="http://boncuklu.org/">http://boncuklu.org</a>), and designed for use on the FAIMS mobile platform available on Android tablets from the Google Play Store. This module is the main medium of data collection on the Boncuklu project allowing the integrated collation of text descriptions (using defined terms), reference photographs, sketches and video/audio records of trenches, features, contexts and finds at the excavation trench.</p>
<p>USERS must be registered with the module administrator (a.fairbairn@uq.edu.au) and login with their User ID at the start of every session.</p>
<p>STRUCTURE. Data are entered into a series of fields via text input, dropdown menus and use of tablet tools such as cameras and microphones, with sketches added from a drawing app. Data fields are organised into a series of logical tabs and tab groups which allow recording of:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Contexts</strong>: individual archaeological entities defined during excavation including deposits, cuts, structures, human skeletons and artefact clusters;</li>
<li><strong>Features</strong>: being groups of associated contexts which together form distinct elements of the site, such as burials (consisting of cuts, skeletons and deposits, on occasion with artefacts and artefact clusters), pits (consisting of cuts and deposits) and hearths (consisting of cuts, structural elements and deposits (fills)). Graves are special types of features, as are buildings;</li>
<li><strong>Artefacts</strong>: as small finds/groundstone items found in contexts, and as artefact clusters, a specific kind of context consisting of a group of associated small finds or groundstone items;</li>
<li><strong>Samples</strong>: quantities of soil or other material collected for specific scientific analysis from contexts;</li>
<li><strong>Photographic log entries</strong>: records of photographs taken as part of the excavation archive.</li>
<li><strong>Diary entries</strong>: Records of events during the excavation at specific excavation trenches.</li>
</ul>
<p>SAVING AND BACKUP: Data are saved automatically as they are entered. The Boncuklu Excavation Module allows syncing to a local or remote server which collates data from multiple devices.</p>
<p>BEWARE: context and feature codes, sample numbers and small find/groundstone numbers must be assigned from the Central Register by trench supervisors and/or the directors.</p>
<h2>Using the Boncuklu excavation module:</h2>
<ol>
<li>Open the FAIMS mobile platform</li>
<li>If you are using the module for the first time:</li>
<ol>
<li>Press the List Modules button</li>
<li>Go to Settings (on Galaxy 8 tablets it is found by pressing the menu button, bottom left)</li>
<li>Choose autodiscover server</li>
<li>Select the latest version of the Boncuklu Excavation Module, install and open.</li>
</ol>
<li>Module Home Page/Login in screen: To enter the module you have to pick your name from the dropdown menu, select the excavation which you are working in and select the relevant device number every time to you login. Your name should be on the user list, if not contact the module administrator (<a href="mailto:a.fairbairn@uq.edu.au">a.fairbairn@uq.edu.au</a>). Once logged in the Navigation Screen will appear (see 4).The Help Tab and Module Guide Button will open up this help item! On the login screen explore two important features which can be used at any time:</li>
<ol>
<li>Sidebar: hold your finger or stylus down on the left margin of the screen and swipe across it. A bar will appear which allows you to navigate through the module and will complement the tab menus on each tab group (contexts, features etc);</li>
<li>Action bar: this is found on the Galaxy tablets by pressing the menu button (bottom left). It allows you to start and stop syncing with the server and to manage GPS devices.</li>
</ol>
<li>Navigation (Control) screen: This screen offers two choices via the Context and Records Tabs and is the navigational origin point for all module operations once logged in.</li>
<ol>
<li>Context tab: buttons allow you to create new:</li>
<ol>
<li>Context records: the description of all individual archaeological entities, forming the core of our descriptive system, and their relationships to other contexts;</li>
<li>Feature records: groups of contexts forming discrete features such as graves, hearths etc, including the relationship of features to each other;</li>
<li>Diary entries: free form notes, photos and audio/video descriptions to be added at any time to document the progress of the excavation;</li>
<li>In addition, values are set here for team member initials when contexts/features are being excavated by multiple diggers. In addition starting values for the context, feature and sample numbers can be added here.</li>
</ol>
<li>Records tab: this is the search engine for selected data fields and allows you to search and open records entered into the module by clicking on them.</li>
<ol>
<li>The searchable entities (contexts, features etc) are listed at the bottom of the screen. To refine the list enter text into the &ldquo;Search term&rdquo; box or use the dropdown menus Entity Type and Trench.</li>
<li>When you find a record click on it to open and edit/view.</li>
<li>The entity list has a very specific format which lists the trench and then whether the entity is a context (Cxtx) or feature (Feat), then the code/number and other information. This makes the entity identifiers easier to understand.</li>
</ol>
</ol>
</ol>
<h2>Adding Context and Feature records</h2>
<ol>
<li>Use the &ldquo;Create new context&rdquo; and &ldquo;New Feature&rdquo; buttons to add new records</li>
<li>All records autosave and no buttons need to be pressed.</li>
<li>As in the 2014 version the data for each context/feature is added in the tabs working from left to right and from top to bottom of the screens. Pressing buttons on some screens (e.g. &ldquo;Fill out context details&rdquo;) opens up new tabs. Use the sidebar and, secondarily, the back button to navigate between tabs.</li>
<li>The &ldquo;Features&rdquo; tab (Feat) in Contexts allows you to add a context to a specified feature and open feature records. The Contexts Tab in features allows you to open context records and assign them to that feature.</li>
<li>Descriptions of fields in the Boncuklu Excavation Module should follow the detailed Recording Guide where dropdown menus are not available.</li>
<li>Essential fields that should be filled in are identified in red. Validate buttons and tabs (abbrev. to Val in the context tab group) allow you to see which of these fields has not been completed for a particular tab/tab group. When all of the red entries have been completed a message will say that everything has been entered. Note that this only applies to the specified core data.</li>
<li>Annotation, certainly and information fields are available via the little icons in the top right of each field. Add text in the annotation fields when additional data are needed which cannot be entered into the main field. When any text is added to the annotation field the pencil icon turns blue.</li>
<li>Relationships between features and contexts require you to relate different contexts and features selected from a list (opened by pressing the &ldquo;Populate target content&rdquo; button&rdquo;), using the range of specified terms in the dropdown menu. Please note that all possible relationships for both contexts and features are present in the lists and correct assignment requires knowledge of the Boncuklu recording system. If you wish to specify relationships to a context or feature excavated in previous years you can add a placeholder for those contexts by pressing the &ldquo;Create Legacy&rdquo; button. Hit that, add the relevant context or feature code from earlier years and you can add it to the relationships.</li>
<li>Photographs, audio and video records can be added to the records directly using the buttons distributed throughout the module (in contexts see the Add tab) which open cameras and microphones on your device.</li>
<li>References to archive photographs can be added using the &ldquo;Add Photographic Log&rdquo; tab and buttons. The Photo ID number in these tabs refers to the standard site photographic log number.</li>
</ol>
<h2><strong>Adding Sketches/Drawings to records in FAIMS</strong></h2>
<p>You cannot prepare sketches within FAIMS but need to use an external app to do so and one that downloads files in a generically readable format. We use Sketchbook Pro, which downloads images in tiff format. This should be pre-loaded on the tablets. These instructions are specifically for Autodesk Sketchbook run on Samsung Galaxy tablets. To view the tiff files it generates on the tablet and in FAIMS via &ldquo;View attached files&rdquo; you also need to download a tiff friendly app such as Fast Image Viewer.</p>
<ol>
<li>To draw a simple sketch:</li>
<ol>
<li>Open the app and run through the tutorial (choose the info/settings icon - it is a cog, second from left) to become familiar with how to use the tools. You can choose various nibs, colours and styles of pen/brush etc and also erasers;</li>
<li>Open a new sketch by pressing the icon containing four squares in the top left and selecting from the menu. Select default resolution or go to custom for higher resolution (for plans etc);</li>
<li>To view the layers, each of which can be drawn upon separately, select the top right icon (looks like 3 sheets of paper superimposed). The layers in your drawing are visible and can be added by pressing the + button and deleted by pressing down and moving to the bin (becomes visible when the layer is held down). Note that the layers are shown in order with the uppermost one at the top. The active layer - that is the one on which you can draw etc - is highlighted in blue</li>
<li>Add a layer and play with the layers to see how this works.</li>
<li>Now draw your sketch on the layer and always write the site code and year (e.g. BK15, trench number) as well as the context code and short description. This can be made very small by zooming in and out (press with two fingers and move together or apart).</li>
<li>Save your creation by going to the &lsquo;four boxes&rsquo; icon in top left corner and pressing save.</li>
<li>The app currently saves the file as .tiff with a random number as filename in its own &lsquo;gallery&rsquo;. You currently cannot change these defaults which is why you must write the context info on the sketch.</li>
</ol>
<li>To import a picture and sketch over it</li>
<ol>
<li>Tap on one of the layers (second one is best) and see options to &lsquo;import picture&rsquo; from camera (takes a new picture) or from a gallery (uses an old picture), etc.</li>
<li>Make sure that your topmost/selected layer is blank and draw on it, making sure to include the site code, context etc as above</li>
<li>Save as above.</li>
<li>You can thus import pro-forma sheets for sketching, such as the BK Skeleton Sheet (should be pre-loaded in your Tablet's Gallery) or take a picture of what you want to sketch and trace over it, retaining or deleting the picture layer as you see fit.</li>
</ol>
<li>To attach the file to a FAIMS record</li>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to the appropriate tab within your module. Press the &ldquo;Attach a sketch/file&rdquo; button.</li>
<li>In the &lsquo;Choose files&rsquo; dialogue navigate to &lsquo;Autodesk&rsquo;. This is usually under &nbsp;&lsquo;emulated&gt;legacy&rsquo;, but may be elsewhere on your device.</li>
<li>If you are importing the sketch immediately select the most recent .tiff file.</li>
<li>You can order items in the folder by pressing the Menu button (bottom left) and selecting &lsquo;Sort by Date&rsquo;.</li>
<li>Tapping the file will attach it to the FAIMS Record.</li>
</ol>
<li>To view the file click on &lsquo;View attached files&rsquo; and tap the filename you want to view. Note that to see tiff files generated by Autodesk Sketchbook you will need to install a tiff capable viewer such as Fast Image Viewer.</li>
