  <Context_ID f="id">
    <desc>Every archaeological context (negative element (cut), deposit, structure, skeleton, artefact cluster) is given a unique 3 or 4 letter context code. Each trench is designated with a separate letter which starts the code, so it is immediately obvious to which trench a context belongs. For example context HAA belongs to Trench H, context MQP to Trench M etc.

    The contexts are labelled consecutively in alphabetical order using the letters following the trench letter. For Trench H the first context would be HAA, the second HAB, the third HAB and so on. In addition sets of letters can denote parts of trenches, buildings etc. E.g. HFs might denote contexts from a specific building.

    Burial context codes begin with the letter Z, followed by the trench letter. Hence burial ZHA is the first burial context from trench H.

    Check with the trench supervisor who will assign the context code from the central register.</desc>

      <opt>{Possibly_Contaminated} 
      <desc>At Boncuklu as at many sites there is significant animal activity represented by burrows. We aim to remove most animal burrow fill. This is easier in contexts with clear and compact sediment characteristics like plaster floors walls building fills more difficult in loose middens. In one sense at Boncuklu as at many sites every context is possibly contaminated but there would be little point in indicating that since it is something we generally understand. Therefore this option is to be
      used to indicate those situations where one may have tried to remove animal introduced or other contamination but are unsure this has been successful and there is a likely but not definitive chance of some later contamination beyond. This option also applies where there may have been later cuts not recognised but we are not sure.</desc></opt>
      <opt>{High_Likely_Contaminated} 
      <desc>It is very likely that significant amounts of earlier artifact and ecofact material has become incorporated in the deposit. For example; is this context a mud brick wall or other structure or building or structural debris or a deposit which has seen the redeposition of material excavated from cuts. These are all situations in which earlier material is likely to have been dug up and re-used (in the mud brick) or re-deposited (when digging out pits).</desc></opt>
